# Glossary of metrics:

Seeding: Each team is seeded from 1 to 16 (generally from strongest to weakest) by the NCAA.

Home Advantage: Teams seeded from 1 to 4 play their first two rounds at home and thus have home advantage for those matches.

Form: For example, if an 8th seed reaches the third round, it means it “took” a 1st seed’s spot (i.e. are in fantastic form) quite likely by beating the 1st seed during the second round).

Adjusted Win Percentage: This essentially “weighs-out” the win percentage by adding more weight to away-wins and home-losses, vice-versa. Reference: https://twitter.com/marchmadness/status/1067063960753573889

Net Efficiency: This essentially measures how efficiently a team converts possession into points relative to how much they have allowed their oppositions to efficiently convert possession into points. Reference: https://twitter.com/marchmadness/status/1067063960753573889
